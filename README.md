# LAD-search ( Local active directory )
VBA/EXCEL Local Active Directory user details search ( Display name, email, NetID )
- This excel VBA scrip opens in an additional excel instance, so you're not blocked using other excel files or macros

Import all 3 files to your excel macro VBA editor
1) ThisWorkbook - Some code on workbook Open ( file )
2) UserForm1 ( file )
3) LAD module ( file )

This was created some years ago, so all improvements welcome ;)
